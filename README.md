# SeeFood

SeeFood is a spoof app I created from the 'Hot Dog' - 'Not Hot Dog' app seen in Silicon Valley. You can take a picture of a hotdog - choose a photo from your photo library - or if you're feeling extra spicy, you can even project a 3D hotdog in augmented reality and take a screenshot of it. Whatever route you choose - the app will let you know if the image contains a hot dog.
